# Bogus Lang

Bogus is a bogus language on top of JVM. It is something that is known as AST Walking Evaluator, and it is done simply  just for educational purposes and fun.

It's worse than javascript. But it works. At some point at least.

## Syntax Example

```
let a = 1;

fun sum(a, b) = a + b;

fun with_scope(a) {
    let b = 5;
    return a - b + 10:
}

let result = with_scope(sum(29, 40));
```

## Running

Start the REPL

```
mvn package && java -cp target/bogus-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar lang.bogus.BogusRepl
```

Evaluate file (not ready yet)

```
mvn package && java -cp target/bogus-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar lang.bogus.Bogus program.bogus
```

## Features

Nothing really fancy. Features under work:

- [ ] Lambda expressions `(a) => a`
- [ ] Closures
- [ ] Standard Library (like `type(a)`)
- [ ] Modules `import lib.bogus`
- [ ] Java interop ðŸ˜‚ `let a = *java.lang.StringBuffer() -> new StringBuffer()`

Probably will not implement

- Threads/async/concurrency
- Optimization (inlining maybe)
